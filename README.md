## **Project Overview**  
MokeSell is an innovative online marketplace designed for users to buy and sell both new and second-hand items. The platform enables seamless account creation, item listing, and secure transactions. To make the user experience more engaging, we have introduced new features such as gamification and treasure hunts. These additions enhance user interaction, foster community engagement, and increase loyalty.  

While retaining core functionalities like account management and transaction handling, MokeSell offers a unique and fun shopping experience that keeps users coming back. We have chosen a neutral color scheme to create a calming and user-friendly environment, ensuring effortless navigation and an overall enhanced user experience.
