MokeSell: A Gamified and Interactive Consumer-to-Consumer Marketplace

Project Overview

MokeSell is an innovative online marketplace designed for users to buy and sell both new and second-hand items. The platform enables seamless account creation, item listing, and secure transactions. To make the user experience more engaging, we have introduced new features such as gamification and treasure hunts. These additions enhance user interaction, foster community engagement, and increase loyalty.

While retaining core functionalities like account management and transaction handling, MokeSell offers a unique and fun shopping experience that keeps users coming back. We have chosen a neutral color scheme to create a calming and user-friendly environment, ensuring effortless navigation and an overall enhanced user experience.

Key Features

1. Gamification

Treasure Hunt

Specially tagged items, such as "Golden Find," can be discovered by browsing the marketplace.

Each category (e.g., electronics, furniture) includes hidden treasures that offer rewards such as discounts, loyalty points, or badges.

The hidden treasure appears as a ‘game console’ icon. Clicking on the icon grants a reward—the bigger the icon, the smaller the reward.

Treasure hunts incentivize users to explore the platform frequently, creating an element of surprise and excitement.

2. Account Management

Account Creation & Login: Simple and secure account registration and login process.

Profile Management: Users can update their personal information and settings with ease.

3. Listing Management

Create Listings: Sellers can list items by uploading photos, selecting categories, and providing detailed descriptions.

Active Listings Limit: Sellers can manage up to 30 active listings for free.

Listing Expiry: Listings automatically become inactive after 30 days to ensure fresh inventory.

4. Browsing and Search

Search Functionality: Buyers can search for specific items using keywords for quick and easy navigation.

Category Browsing: Browse items by categories or sub-categories for an organized and efficient shopping experience.

Save Listings: Users can "like" and save favorite items for future reference.

5. Transaction Management

Chat Feature: Integrated chat system for direct communication between buyers and sellers to discuss transaction details.

Offer Submission: Buyers can submit offers directly through the platform, allowing for flexible negotiations.

Review System: After each transaction, users can leave reviews and ratings based on various criteria, promoting trust and transparency.
